title: Are Time Series Foundation Models Ready for Vital Sign Forecasting in Healthcare?
abstract: The rise of foundation models, particularly large language models like ChatGPT,
  has revolutionized natural language processing and demonstrated remarkable generalization
  across numerous healthcare applications. Building on this success, foundation models
  for time series forecasting have emerged, offering new opportunities by leveraging
  pretraining on large-scale datasets. However, existing time series foundation models
  are pretrained with minimal clinical data, and their potentials for continuously
  recorded clinical time series, such as vital signs, remain largely under-explored.
  This motivates our endeavor to integrate time series foundation models with vital
  sign data to address critical clinical challenges, particularly in predicting patient
  deterioration. Through an extensive evaluation of various settings and configurations
  of these models, alongside comparisons with conventional forecasting models, we
  highlight the significant opportunities for improvement in developing clinically
  useful time series forecasting models. In a word, the “ChatGPT” moment for time
  series foundation models, in the typical clinical domain, is yet to come.
