title: Uncertainty Quantification for Conditional Treatment Effect Estimation under
  Dynamic Treatment Regimes
abstract: In medical decision-making, clinicians must choose between different time-varying
  treatment strategies. Counterfactual prediction via g-computation enables comparison
  of alternative outcome distributions under such treatment strategies. While deep
  learning can better model high-dimensional data with complex temporal dependencies,
  incorporating model uncertainty into predicted conditional counterfactual distributions
  remains challenging. We propose a principled approach to model uncertainty in deep
  learning implementations of g-computations using approximate Bayesian posterior
  predictive distributions of counterfactual outcomes via variational dropout and
  deep ensembles. We evaluate these methods by comparing their counterfactual predictive
  calibration and performance in decision-making tasks, using two simulated datasets
  from mechanistic models and a real-world sepsis dataset. Our findings suggest that
  the proposed uncertainty quantification approach improves both calibration and decision-making
  performance, particularly in minimizing risks of worst-case adverse clinical outcomes
  under alternative dynamic treatment regimes. To our knowledge, this is the first
  work to propose and compare multiple uncertainty quantification methods in machine
  learning models of g-computation in estimating conditional treatment effects under
  dynamic treatment regimes.
