title: 'MIK: Modified Isolation Kernel for Biological Sequence Visualization, Classification,
  and Clustering'
abstract: The t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) has emerged as a
  popular dimensionality reduction technique for visualizing high-dimensional data.
  It computes pairwise similarities between data points by default using an RBF kernel
  and random initialization (in low-dimensional space), which successfully captures
  the overall structure but may struggle to preserve the local structure efficiently.
  This research proposes a novel approach called the Modified Isolation Kernel (MIK)
  as an alternative to the Gaussian kernel, which is built upon the concept of the
  Isolation Kernel. MIK uses adaptive density estimation to capture local structures
  more accurately and integrates robustness measures. It also assigns higher similarity
  values to nearby points and lower values to distant points. Comparative research
  using the normal Gaussian kernel, the isolation kernel, and several initialization
  techniques, including random, PCA, and random walk initializations, are used to
  assess the proposed approach (MIK). Additionally, we compare the computational efficiency
  of all $3$ kernels with $3$ different initialization methods. Our experimental results
  demonstrate several advantages of the proposed kernel (MIK) and initialization method
  selection. It exhibits improved preservation of the local and global structure and
  enables better visualization of clusters and subclusters in the embedded space.
  These findings contribute to advancing dimensionality reduction techniques and provide
  researchers and practitioners with an effective tool for data exploration, visualization,
  and analysis in various domains.
