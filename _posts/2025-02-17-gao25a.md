title: Query-Guided Self-Supervised Summarization of Nursing Notes
abstract: 'Nursing notes, an important part of Electronic Health Records (EHRs), track
  a patient’s health during a care episode. Summarizing key information in nursing
  notes can help clinicians quickly understand patients’ conditions. However, existing
  summarization methods in the clinical setting, especially abstractive methods, have
  overlooked nursing notes and require reference summaries for training. We introduce
  QGSumm, a novel query-guided self-supervised domain adaptation approach for abstractive
  nursing note summarization. The method uses patient-related clinical queries for
  guidance, and hence does not need reference summaries for training. Through automatic
  experiments and manual evaluation by an expert clinician, we study our approach
  and other state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) for nursing note summarization.
  Our experiments show: 1) GPT-4 is competitive in maintaining information in the
  original nursing notes, 2) QGSumm can generate high-quality summaries with a good
  balance between recall of the original content and hallucination rate lower than
  other top methods. Ultimately, our work offers a new perspective on conditional
  text summarization, tailored to clinical applications.'
