title: 'RespLLM: Unifying Audio and Text with Multimodal LLMs for Generalized Respiratory
  Health Prediction'
abstract: The high incidence and mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases
  underscores the importance of early screening. Machine learning models can automate
  clinical consultations and auscultation, offering vital support in this area. However,
  the data involved, spanning demographics, medical history, symptoms, and respiratory
  audio, are heterogeneous and complex. Existing approaches are insufficient and lack
  generalizability, as they typically rely on limited training data, basic fusion
  techniques, and task-specific design. In this paper, we propose RespLLM, a novel
  multimodal large language model (LLM) framework that unifies text and audio representations
  for respiratory health prediction. RespLLM leverages the extensive prior knowledge
  of pretrained LLMs and enables effective audio-text fusion through cross-modal attentions.
  Instruction tuning is employed to integrate diverse data from multiple sources,
  ensuring generalizability and versatility of the model. Experiments on five real-world
  datasets demonstrate that RespLLM outperforms leading baselines by an average of
  4.6% on trained tasks, 7.9% on unseen datasets, and facilitates zero-shot predictions
  for new tasks. Our work lays the foundation for multimodal models that can perceive,
  listen to, and understand heterogeneous data, paving the way for scalable respiratory
  health diagnosis.
