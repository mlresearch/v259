title: 'HIST-AID: Leveraging Historical Patient Reports for Enhanced Multi-Modal Automatic
  Diagnosis'
abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is a widely accessible and non-invasive diagnostic tool
  for detecting thoracic abnormalities. While numerous AI models assist radiologists
  in interpreting these images, most overlook patients’ historical data. To bridge
  this gap, we introduce Temporal MIMIC dataset, which integrates five years of patient
  history, including radiographic scans and reports from MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-IV, encompassing
  12,221 patients and thirteen pathologies. Building on this, we present HIST-AID,
  a framework that enhances automatic diagnostic accuracy using historical reports.
  HIST-AID emulates the radiologist’s comprehensive approach, leveraging historical
  data to improve diagnostic accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements,
  with AUROC increasing by 6.56% and AUPRC by 9.51% compared to models that rely solely
  on radiographic scans. These gains were consistently observed across diverse demo-
  graphic groups, including variations in gender, age, and racial categories. We show
  that while recent data boost performance, older data may reduce accuracy due to
  changes in patient conditions. Our work paves the potential of incor- porating historical
  data for more reliable automatic diagnosis, providing critical support for clinical
  decision-making.
