title: Topological Machine Learning for Low Data Medical Imaging
abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has revolutionized medical image analysis by providing
  automated techniques to extract valuable insights from large datasets. However,
  challenges such as interpretability and reliance on extensive labeled data persist.
  Topological Data Analysis (TDA) has emerged as a complementary approach that captures
  underlying topological structures in data, potentially enhancing the performance
  of DL models. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of TDA methods
  for computer-aided diagnosis from two perspectives. First, we examine the effectiveness
  of topological methods in data-limited settings by comparing the standalone performance
  of DL models, TDA approaches, and their fusion. Our results demonstrate that integrating
  topological features into DL models significantly improves performance when labeled
  data are scarce. Second, we assess the standalone performance of TDA methods in
  data-rich environments using the MedMNIST collection, which includes over 600K images
  across 12 2D and 6 3D medical imaging datasets. Our experiments reveal that while
  TDA methods do not outperform DL models on 2D datasets, they achieve competitive
  results on 3D imaging tasks. These findings suggest that the fusion of TDA and DL
  methods can enhance the accuracy and robustness of computer-aided diagnosis, particularly
  in low-data or 3D imaging scenarios.
