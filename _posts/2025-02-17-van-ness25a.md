title: 'DNAMite: Interpretable Calibrated Survival Analysis with Discretized Additive
  Models'
abstract: Survival analysis is a classic problem in statistics with important applications
  in healthcare. Most machine learning models for survival analysis are black-box
  models, limiting their use in healthcare settings where interpretability is paramount.
  More recently, glass-box machine learning models have been introduced for survival
  analysis, with both strong predictive performance and interpretability. Still, several
  gaps remain, as no prior glass-box survival model can produce calibrated shape functions
  with enough flexibility to capture the complex patterns often found in real data.
  To fill this gap, we introduce a new glass-box machine learning model for survival
  analysis called DNAMite. DNAMite uses feature discretization and kernel smoothing
  in its embedding module, making it possible to learn shape functions with a flexible
  balance of smoothness and jaggedness. Further, DNAMite produces calibrated shape
  functions that can be directly interpreted as contributions to the cumulative incidence
  function. Our experiments show that DNAMite generates shape functions closer to
  true shape functions on synthetic data, while making predictions with comparable
  predictive performance and better calibration than previous glass-box and black-box
