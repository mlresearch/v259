title: 'RadFlag: A Black-Box Hallucination Detection Method for Medical Vision Language
  Models'
abstract: Generating accurate radiology reports from medical images is a clinically
  important but challenging task. While current vision language models show promise,
  they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care.
  We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report
  generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory
  generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying
  temperatures and then use a large language model to identify claims that are not
  consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence
  in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims
  as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically
  rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory
  sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box
  system that only requires access to a modelâ€™s temperature parameter, RadFlag is
  compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential
  to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.
