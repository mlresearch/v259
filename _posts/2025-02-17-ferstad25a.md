title: 'Learning Explainable Treatment Policies with Clinician-Informed Representations:
  A Practical Approach'
abstract: Digital health interventions (DHIs) and remote patient monitoring (RPM)
  have shown great potential in improving chronic disease management through personalized
  care. However, barriers like limited efficacy and workload concerns hinder adoption
  of existing DHIs, and limited sample sizes and lack of interpretability limit the
  effectiveness and adoption of purely black-box algorithmic DHIs. In this paper,
  we address these challenges by developing a pipeline for learning explainable treatment
  policies for RPM-enabled DHIs. We apply our approach in the real-world setting of
  RPM using a DHI to improve glycemic control of youth with type 1 diabetes. Our main
  contribution is to reveal the importance of \emph{clinical domain knowledge} in
  developing state and action representations for effective, efficient, and interpretable
  targeting policies. We observe that policies learned from clinician-informed representations
  are significantly more efficacious and efficient than policies learned from black-box
  representations. This work emphasizes the importance of collaboration between ML
  researchers and clinicians for developing effective DHIs in the real world.
