title: Self-Supervised Probability Imputation to Estimate the External-Natural Cause
  of Injury Matrix
abstract: The burden of injuries is essential to public health planning and policy
  making. Public health scientists rely on estimating the probability of nature-of-injuries
  (NI) for external causes of injuries (ECI) to calculate metrics used to describe
  burden of injuries globally. With more than 30 million records collected from 15
  countries that include ECI with NI, in this study we develop a novel method to estimate
  probability of NI for ECI using self-supervised matrix imputation. We formulate
  learning the probability of NI for ECI for our data as a matrix imputation from
  noisy labels problem. Subsequently, we benchmark the collected data on 16 existing
  matrix imputation methods to uncover the best performing method for our data. Using
  self-supervision and data augmentation to curb the modelâ€™s tendency to overfit to
  noisy labels, our matrix imputation approach improves test set RMSE by 7.36% compared
  to the best performing imputation model used for benchmarking. In addition, the
  proposed self-supervised approach reduces the Euclidean distance of NI probabilities
  among age groups with similar probabilities by up to 20% without impacting model
  performance and uses counterfactual data augmentation (CDA) to mitigate potential
  biases from age, sex, platform, and country income status.
