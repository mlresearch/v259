title: 'Generalized Prompt Tuning: Adapting Frozen Univariate Time Series Foundation
  Models for Multivariate Healthcare Time Series'
abstract: Time series foundation models are pre-trained on large datasets and are
  able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in diverse tasks. However, to date,
  there has been limited work demonstrating how well these models perform in medical
  applications, where labeled data can be scarce. Further, we observe that currently,
  the majority of time series foundation models either are univariate in nature, or
  assume channel independence, meaning that they handle multivariate time series but
  do not model how the different variables relate. In this paper, we propose a prompt-tuning-inspired
  fine-tuning technique, Generalized Prompt Tuning (Gen-P-Tuning), that enables us
  to adapt an existing univariate time series foundation model (treated as frozen)
  to handle multivariate time series prediction. Our approach provides a way to combine
  information across channels (variables) of multivariate time series. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our fine-tuning approach against various baselines on two MIMIC
  classification tasks, and on influenza-like illness forecasting.
