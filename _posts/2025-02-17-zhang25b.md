title: Uncertainty-Aware Personalized Federated Learning for Realistic Healthcare
  Applications
abstract: Healthcare applications require accurate and uncertainty-aware machine learning
  models, providing confidence rather than only blackbox predictions. However, training
  such deep learning models with insufficient data at individual sites (e.g., hospitals)
  poses a challenge. Federated learning (FL) mitigates this by allowing data holders
  to collaboratively train models without sharing sensitive health data. Yet, we identify
  two major realistic challenges when building uncertainty estimates in FL, severe
  data heterogeneity and high computational overhead. This paper proposes FedEE, an
  uncertainty-aware and efficient personalized FL framework for realistic healthcare
  applications. FedEE achieves an efficient way of ensembling by incorporating lightweight
  early exit blocks into a single backbone model. These blocks are personalized for
  each client to tackle data heterogeneity. Experiments with four FL strategies and
  three datasets demonstrate that FedEE achieves up to a 15% improvement in uncertainty
  estimation from vanilla softmax entropy and is competitive with expensive baselines,
  showcasing in the order of 5Ã— improved efficiency with a 5-member ensemble.
