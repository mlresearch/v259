title: 'Mapping Three-Dimensional Tumor Heterogeneity through Deep Learning Inference
  of Spatial Transcriptomics from Routine Histopathology: A Proof-of-Concept Comparative
  Study'
abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies enable the mapping of gene and
  protein abundance within specific tissue architectures, representing a significant
  advancement over conventional bulk analyses that can obscure critical prognostic
  markers tied to spatial contexts. Expanding these analyses to three dimensions (3D)
  can further uncover intricate biomolecular phenomena that may be truncated or missed
  in two-dimensional (2D) studies. However, the widespread application of 3D ST profiling
  is limited by high costs and logistical challenges. Deep learning-based inference
  of ST data from routine histopathological staining offers a cost-effective alternative,
  allowing for the exploration of histologically associated biological pathways in
  3D and enhancing our ability to detect structures linked to tumor progression. In
  this proof-of-concept study, we employed deep learning models to infer ST data from
  routine histopathology for 10 colorectal cancer patients, with 10 serial sections
  analyzed per patient. Our downstream analyses revealed several key instances where
  3D approaches provided enhanced insights into cellular phenomena compared to traditional
  2D methods. These findings lay the groundwork for future research aimed at leveraging
  these methods to investigate subtle 3D biomarkers associated with tumor metastasis
  and recurrence.
