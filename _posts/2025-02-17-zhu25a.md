title: 'Towards a personalized pregnancy experience: Forecasting symptoms using graph
  neural networks and digital health technologies'
abstract: Pregnancy is an intricate process involving substantial physiological changes
  that impact both maternal and fetal health. In this study, we demonstrate the ability
  to predict two common symptoms during the third trimester of pregnancy—edema and
  fatigue—using physiological measures from wearable devices and self-reported daily
  surveys from mobile apps. Our approach employs a Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework,
  enhanced with a modified weighted Cross-Entropy loss to improve prediction performance.
  The model achieved AUC scores of 77.27% for edema and 69.70% for fatigue. Additionally,
  we aligned data from self-reported pregnancy symptoms with clinical examinations
  to carefully select participant cohorts for our experiments. We also explored how
  various features identified by the GNN are linked to these symptoms, gaining deeper
  insights into the relationship between physiological measures and pregnancy symptoms.
  Our findings indicate that heart rate variability plays a significant role in predicting
  symptoms of edema and fatigue, and features related to low-intensity activity also
  have a notable impact. Some of our findings closely align with previous studies
  on pregnancy. Our research serves as a proof of concept that symptoms can be predicted
  using wearable data, which may enhance the immediate well-being of expectant mothers
  and potentially personalize the overall pregnancy experience.
