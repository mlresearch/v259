title: State space modeling of multidien cyclical progression of epilepsy
abstract: The risk of seizures in epilepsy fluctuates in cycles with multiday periodicity.
  The strength of these patient-specific seizure risk cycles can be modulated by disease
  processes. There is a lack of computational models of epilepsy that describe the
  progression and modulation of multiday seizure risk cycles. We developed a state
  space model (SSM) for epilepsy progression that learns individualized multiday seizure
  risk cycles from intracranial EEG (iEEG) data. To capture the cyclical nature of
  seizure risk, our model incorporated cyclical dynamics by using a special rotation
  matrix structure for the state transition matrix. The model learned patient-specific
  multiday cycles using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm. We evaluated the
  model on real-world data from one of the longest continuous iEEG recordings in people
  with epilepsy. The model forecast iEEG and inferred periods of heightened risk of
  seizures better than or comparable to baseline models, and provided novel insight
  into biological factors that modulate seizure risk cycles. To demonstrate the value
  of the model in developing brain stimulation treatment, the proposed SSM was integrated
  with reinforcement learning to reduce seizure risk in silico. Our model holds significant
  potential for addressing clinically important problems.
