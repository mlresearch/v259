title: 'CoRE-BOLD: Cross-Domain Robust and Equitable Ensemble for BOLD Signal Analysis'
abstract: 'In current neuroimaging studies aimed at analysing BOLD signals, the focus
  has primarily been on correlation-based features derived from time series data.
  Considering Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), a widespread psychiatric condition,
  poses a complex and poorly understood pathology. Recent research has increasingly
  linked MDD to disruptions in brain connectivity, as observed through functional
  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Identifying the brain regions associated with
  neurological disorders and cognitive processes remains a central objective in neuroimaging
  studies. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed to extract
  disease-relevant information from fMRI data, existing methods face significant limitations.
  These limitations include neglecting the frequency-domain characteristics of neuronal
  interactions, inadequately incorporating non-imaging biomarkers such as sex and
  age, and paying insufficient attention to bias and model stability, which leaves
  models prone to small perturbations. We introduce CoRE-BOLD, a unified framework
  addressing these gaps for MDD diagnosis in this study. CoRE-BOLD employs an ensemble
  of stacked networks that learn complementary representations from both correlation-
  and coherence-based functional connectivities. To further improve the model, we
  enforce orthonormality constraints on the graph convolutional filters to enhance
  intra-network diversity and apply a diversity-maximizing regularizer for inter-network
  diversity. Unlike previous studies, which incorporate non-imaging sensitive attributes
  as biomarkers but inadvertently introduce bias, CoRE-BOLD mitigates this through
  a prejudice remover regularizer, promoting fairness in representation learning across
  both underrepresented and favored groups. Our experimental evaluation on the REST-meta-MDD
  dataset demonstrates the efficacy of CoRE-BOLD as a robust and fair framework for
  BOLD signal analysis in MDD detection, positioning it as a promising solution for
  real-world medical applications. Source code of CoRE-BOLD is freely available at:
