title: Towards Preventing Intimate Partner Violence by Detecting Disagreements in
  SMS Communications
abstract: 'Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) among adolescents is a major public health
  concern, particularly for justice-involved adolescents which are at higher risk
  of experiencing IPV. Early detection of disagreements between romantic partners
  can provide an opportunity for just-in-time interventions to prevent escalation.
  Prior work has proposed methods for early detection of disagreements based on metadata
  features of text message conversations. In this work, we build on these prior efforts
  and investigate the impact of explicitly modeling the contents of text conversations
  for disagreement detection. We develop and evaluate supervised classifiers that
  combine metadata features with sentiment and semantic features of texts and compare
  their performance against few-shot learning with instruction-tuned Large Language
  Models (LLMs). We conduct experiments on a dataset collected to study the communication
  patterns and risk factors associated with IPV among justice-involved adolescents.
  In addition, we measure modelsâ€™ generalization to out-of-distribution samples using
  an external dataset comprising adolescents enrolled in child welfare services. We
  find that: (i) text-based features improve predictive performance but do not help
  models generalize to other populations; and (ii) LLMs struggle in this setting but
  can outperform supervised classifiers in out-of-distribution samples.'
