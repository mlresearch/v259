title: 'Uncovering Judgment Biases in Emergency Triage: A Public Health Approach Based
  on Large Language Models'
abstract: 'Judgment biases in emergency triage can adversely affect patient outcomes.
  This study examines sex/gender biases using four advanced language models fine-tuned
  on real-world emergency department data. We introduce a novel approach based on
  the testing method, commonly used in hiring bias detection, by automatically altering
  triage notes to change patient sex references. Results indicate a significant bias:
  female patients are assigned lower severity ratings than male patients with identical
  clinical conditions. This bias is more pronounced with female nurses or when patients
  report higher pain levels but diminishes with increased nurse experience. Identifying
  these biases can inform interventions such as enhanced training, protocol updates,
  and machine learning tools to support clinical decision-making.'
