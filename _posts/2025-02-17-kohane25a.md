title: The Human Values Project
abstract: Alignment of AI models to ensure that they are safe and useful decision-aids
  or decision-makers in human society is close to the top of the technical concerns
  of many if not most major AI deployment efforts. Here I explore a class of categorical
  decisions, triage, for which AI models are already being used in medicine. I use
  this to motivate the urgent need for an international Human Values Project (HVP)
  that will be at least as hungry for empirical data as any existing international
  project. A major component of the HVP will be the Clinical Decision Dynamics Study
  that captures descriptive and normative decisions across a wide range of clinical
  context and from highly diverse, lay and professional perspectives. Along the way,
  there are important preliminary studies that the AI (and medicine) community should
  embrace.
