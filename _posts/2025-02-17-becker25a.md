title: 'RESIST: Remapping EIT Signals Using Implicit Spatially-Aware Transformer'
abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) aims to reconstruct the body’s internal
  electrical conductivity distribution from surface voltage measurements. This non-invasive,
  non-ionizing, and cost-effective technique is valuable for medical applications,
  offering potential for long- term monitoring of lung functionality and condition.
  However, existing methods of absolute EIT provide blurred tomograms that are difficult
  to interpret, do not resemble the human topography and are therefore of limited
  use for clinical applications. We propose RESIST, a new data-driven approach that
  integrates prior geometry of human bodies and conductivity information by combining
  an implicit neural network with a transformer model in an encoder-decoder framework.
  RESIST maps simultaneous EIT measurements from multiple body levels to conductivity
  values at any coordinate in a 3D body volume. We train RESIST on simulated EIT measurements
  based on 3D human body CT segmentations. We find that it is robust against distortions
  in the signal and exact placement of electrodes, correctly infers interpolation
  laws, and generalizes to real EIT measurements in humans.
