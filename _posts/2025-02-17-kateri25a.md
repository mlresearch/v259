title: 'ST2S-rPPG: A Spatiotemporal Two-Stage Learning Approach for Pulse Estimation
  Using Video'
abstract: Remote physiological monitoring presents an opportunity to enhance patient
  care, particularly in scenarios where traditional monitoring methods are impractical
  or unavailable. Heart rate, being a principal indicator of health, has been a focal
  point of video-based monitoring systems. Despite significant advancements in remote
  photoplethysmography technology, several challenges persist, including motion artifacts,
  data homogeneity and availability, which impact the accuracy and reliability of
  such solutions. In this work, we introduce a novel framework aimed at addressing
  these challenges, ST2S-rPPG. Our methodology involves a stabilization method to
  mitigate motion artifacts. We propose a spatiotemporal representation of video data,
  which captures predictive available information in the video and assists in transforming
  the input video. We present a unique approach to ground truth representation for
  capturing more informative features. Finally, we incorporate a two-stage learning
  component into our framework to optimize estimation accuracy. Through evaluations
  on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions and
  their practical relevance in healthcare applications.
