title: 'From Isolation to Collaboration: Federated Class-Heterogeneous Learning for
  Chest X-Ray Classification'
abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to collaboratively train
  a global chest x-ray (CXR) classification model using distributed datasets while
  preserving patient privacy. A significant, yet relatively underexplored, challenge
  in FL is class-heterogeneity, where clients have different sets of classes. We propose
  surgical aggregation, a FL method that uses selective aggregation to collaboratively
  train a global model using distributed, class-heterogeneous datasets. Unlike other
  methods, our method does not rely on the assumption that clients share the same
  classes as other clients, know the classes of other clients, or have access to a
  fully annotated dataset. We evaluate surgical aggregation using class-heterogeneous
  CXR datasets across IID and non-IID settings. Our results show that our method outperforms
  current methods and has better generalizability.
