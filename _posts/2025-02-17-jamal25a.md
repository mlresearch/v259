title: Rethinking RGB-D Fusion for Semantic Segmentation in Surgical Datasets
abstract: Surgical scene understanding is a key technical component for enabling intelligent
  and context aware systems that can transform various aspects of surgical interventions.
  In this work, we focus on the semantic segmentation task, propose a simple yet effective
  multi-modal (RGB and depth) training framework called SurgDepth, and show state-of-the-art
  (SOTA) results on all publicly available datasets applicable for this task. Unlike
  previous approaches, which either fine-tune SOTA segmentation models trained on
  natural images, or encode RGB or RGB-D information using RGB only pre-trained backbones,
  SurgDepth, which is built on top of Vision Transformers (ViTs), is designed to encode
  both RGB and depth information through a simple fusion mechanism. We conduct extensive
  experiments on benchmark datasets including EndoVis2022, AutoLapro, LapI2I and EndoVis2017
  to verify the efficacy of SurgDepth. Specifically, SurgDepth achieves a new SOTA
  IoU of 0.86 on EndoVis 2022 SAR-RARP50 challenge and outperforms the current best
  method by at least 4%, using a shallow and compute efficient decoder consisting
  of ConvNeXt blocks.
