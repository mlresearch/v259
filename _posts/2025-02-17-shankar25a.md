title: Estimating Counterfactual Distributions under Interference
abstract: 'Randomized control trials (RCTs) form a key tool for evaluating medical
  treatments. However commonly used techniques in RCT based treatment effect estimates
  suffer from two issues: a) ignoring spillover effects and b) focusing on average
  (or conditional) average effects. This is partly because evaluating counterfactual
  distributions is hard; and is further complicated by presence of interference. In
  this work we propose a new estimator, named RUMI, for estimating distributional
  quantities like CVaR, QTE from controlled trials under known interference. We provide
  theoretical justification behind our method and demonstrate its application using
  synthetic experiments and real data.'
