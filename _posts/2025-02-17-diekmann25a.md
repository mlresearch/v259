title: Evaluating Safety of Large Language Models for Patient-facing Medical Question
  Answering
abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the question answering
  (QA) domain by achieving near-human performance across a broad range of tasks. Recent
  studies have suggested LLMs are capable of answering clinical questions and providing
  medical advice. Although LLMsâ€™ answers must be reliable and safe, existing evaluations
  of medical QA systems often only focus on the accuracy of the content. However,
  a critical, underexplored aspect is whether variations in patient inquiries - rephrasing
  the same question - lead to inconsistent or unsafe LLM responses. We propose a new
  evaluation methodology leveraging synthetic question generation to rigorously assess
  the safety of LLMs in patient-facing medical QA. In benchmarking 8 LLMs, we observe
  a weak correlation between standard automated quality metrics and human evaluations,
  underscoring the need for enhanced sensitivity analysis in evaluating patient medical
  QA safety.
