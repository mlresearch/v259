title: 'Barttender: An approachable & interpretable way to compare medical imaging
  and non-imaging data'
abstract: Imaging-based deep learning has transformed healthcare research, yet its
  clinical adoption remains limited due to challenges in comparing imaging models
  with traditional non-imaging and tabular data. To bridge this gap, we introduce
  Barttender, an interpretable framework that uses deep learning for the direct comparison
  of the utility of imaging versus non-imaging tabular data for tasks like disease
  prediction. Barttender converts non-imaging tabular features, such as scalar data
  from electronic health records, into grayscale bars, facilitating an interpretable
  and scalable deep learning based modeling of both data modalities. Our framework
  allows researchers to evaluate differences in utility through performance measures,
  as well as local (sample-level) and global (population-level) explanations. We introduce
  a novel measure to define global feature importances for image-based deep learning
  models, which we call gIoU. Experiments on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets with
  chest X-rays and scalar data from electronic health records show that Barttender
  performs comparably to traditional methods and offers enhanced explainability using
  deep learning models.
