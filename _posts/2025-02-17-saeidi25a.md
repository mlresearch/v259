title: 'Streamlining Clinical Trial Recruitment: A Two-Stage Zero-Shot LLM Approach
  with Advanced Prompting'
abstract: Identifying patient eligibility for clinical trials is a critical bottleneck
  hindering medical research progress because many clinical trials allow only small,
  specific patient cohorts to be included and require a certain number of participating
  patients to yield definitive results. Manually screening patients through unstructured
  medical records is time-consuming and expensive. This paper explores the potential
  of large language models (LLMs) enhanced with medical context to automate patient
  eligibility assessments for clinical trials. We first design a two-stage zero-shot
  LLM approach to analyze a patientâ€™s medical history (presented as unstructured text)
  and to determine their eligibility for a specific trial. We use advanced prompting
  strategies to guide the LLM toward faster and more targeted matches between trials
  and eligible patients. Additionally, a two-stage retrieval pipeline pre-filters
  potential trials using efficient retrieval techniques, reducing the number of trials
  considered for each patient. This two-way matching substantially improves processing
  speed and cost-effectiveness for clinical trial recruitment. Our method holds promise
  for streamlining clinical trial patient recruitment to accelerate medical advances.
