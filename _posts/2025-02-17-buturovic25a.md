title: Development of Machine Learning Classifiers for Blood-based Diagnosis and Prognosis
  of Suspected Acute Infections and Sepsis
abstract: We applied machine learning to the unmet medical need of rapid and accurate
  diagnosis and prognosis of acute infections and sepsis in emergency departments.
  Our solution consists of a Myrna Instrument and embedded TriVerity classifiers.
  The instrument measures abundances of 29 messenger RNAs in patientâ€™s blood, subsequently
  used as features for machine learning. The classifiers convert the input features
  to an intuitive test report comprising the separate likelihoods of (1) a bacterial
  infection (2) a viral infection, and (3) severity (need for Intensive Care Unit-level
  care). In internal validation, the system achieved AUROC = 0.83 on the three-class
  disease diagnosis (bacterial, viral, or non-infected) and AUROC = 0.77 on binary
  prognosis of disease severity. The Myrna, TriVerity system was granted breakthrough
  device designation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This
  engineering manuscript teaches the standard and novel machine learning methods used
  to translate an academic research concept to a clinical product aimed at improving
  patient care, and discusses lessons learned.
