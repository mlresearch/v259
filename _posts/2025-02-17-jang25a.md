title: Fundus Image-based Visual Acuity Assessment with PAC-Guarantees
abstract: Timely detection and treatment are essential for maintaining eye health.
  Visual acuity (VA), which measures the clarity of vision at a distance, is a crucial
  metric for managing eye health. Machine learning (ML) techniques have been introduced
  to assist in VA measurement, potentially alleviating cliniciansâ€™ workloads. However,
  the inherent uncertainties in ML models make relying solely on them for VA prediction
  less than ideal. The VA prediction task involves multiple sources of uncertainty,
  requiring more robust approaches. A promising method is to build prediction sets
  or intervals rather than point estimates, offering coverage guarantees through techniques
  like conformal prediction and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) prediction sets.
  Despite the potential, to date, these approaches have not been applied to the VA
  prediction task.To address this, we propose a method for deriving prediction intervals
  for estimating visual acuity from fundus images with a PAC guarantee. Our experimental
  results demonstrate that the PAC guarantees are upheld, with performance comparable
  to or better than that of two prior works that do not provide such guarantees.
