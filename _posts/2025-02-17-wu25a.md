title: 'DILA: Dictionary Label Attention for Mechanistic Interpretability in High-dimensional
  Multi-label Medical Coding Prediction'
abstract: Automated medical coding, a clinical high-dimensional multilabel task, requires
  explicit interpretability. Existing works often rely on local interpretability methods,
  failing to provide comprehensive explanations of the overall mechanism behind each
  label prediction within a multilabel set. We propose a mechanistic interpretability
  module called DIctionary Label Attention (DILA) that disentangles uninterpretable
  dense embeddings into a sparse embedding space, where each nonzero element (a dictionary
  feature) represents a globally learned medical concept. Through human evaluations,
  we show that our sparse embeddings are more human understandable than its dense
  counterparts by at least 50 percent. Our automated dictionary feature identification
  pipeline, leveraging large language models (LLMs), uncovers thousands of learned
  medical concepts by examining and summarizing the highest activating tokens for
  each dictionary feature. We represent the relationships between dictionary features
  and medical codes through a sparse interpretable matrix, enhancing our global understanding
  of the modelâ€™s predictions while maintaining competitive performance and scalability
  without extensive human annotation.
