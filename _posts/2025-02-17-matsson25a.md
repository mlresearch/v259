title: How Should We Represent History in Interpretable Models of Clinical Policies?
abstract: Modeling policies for sequential clinical decision-making based on observational
  data is useful for describing treatment practices, standardizing frequent patterns
  in treatment, and evaluating alternative policies. For each task, it is essential
  that the policy model is interpretable. Learning accurate models requires effectively
  capturing a patientâ€™s state, either through sequence representation learning or
  carefully crafted summaries of their medical history. While recent work has favored
  the former, it remains a question as to how histories should best be represented
  for interpretable policy modeling. Focused on model fit, we systematically compare
  diverse approaches to summarizing patient history for interpretable modeling of
  clinical policies across four sequential decision-making tasks. We illustrate differences
  in the policies learned using various representations by breaking down evaluations
  by patient subgroups, critical states, and stages of treatment, highlighting challenges
  specific to common use cases. We find that interpretable sequence models using learned
  representations perform on par with black-box models across all tasks. Interpretable
  models using hand-crafted representations perform substantially worse when ignoring
  history entirely, but are made competitive by incorporating only a few aggregated
  and recent elements of patient history. The added benefits of using a richer representation
  are pronounced for subgroups and in specific use cases. This underscores the importance
  of evaluating policy models in the context of their intended use.
