title: 'U-Fair: Uncertainty-based Multimodal Multitask Learning for Fairer Depression
  Detection'
abstract: Machine learning bias in mental health is becoming an increasingly pertinent
  challenge. Despite promising efforts indicating that multitask approaches often
  work better than unitask approaches, there is minimal work investigating the impact
  of multitask learning on performance and fairness in depression detection nor leveraged
  it to achieve fairer prediction outcomes. In this work, we undertake a systematic
  investigation of using a multitask approach to improve performance and fairness
  for depression detection. We propose a novel gender-based task-reweighting method
  using uncertainty grounded in how the PHQ-8 questionnaire is structured. Our results
  indicate that, although a multitask approach improves performance and fairness compared
  to a unitask approach, the results are not always consistent and we see evidence
  of negative transfer and a reduction in the Pareto frontier, which is concerning
  given the high-stake healthcare setting. Our proposed approach of gender-based reweighting
  with uncertainty improves performance and fairness and alleviates both challenges
  to a certain extent. Our findings on each PHQ-8 subitem task difficulty are also
  in agreement with the largest study conducted on the PHQ-8 subitem discrimination
  capacity, thus providing the very first tangible evidence linking ML findings with
  large-scale empirical population studies conducted on the PHQ-8.
