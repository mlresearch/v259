title: Training-Aware Risk Control for Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapies Quality
  Assurance with Conformal Prediction
abstract: Measurement quality assurance (QA) prac- tices play a key role in the safe
  use of Inten- sity Modulated Radiation Therapies (IMRT) for cancer treatment. These
  practices have re- duced measurement-based IMRT QA failure be- low 1%. However,
  these practices are time and labor intensive which can lead to delays in pa- tient
  care. In this study, we examine how con- formal prediction methodologies can be
  used to robustly triage plans. We propose a new training-aware conformal risk control
  method by combining the benefit of conformal risk con- trol and conformal training.
  We incorporate the decision-making thresholds based on the GPR, along with the risk
  functions used in clinical evaluation, into the design of the risk control framework.
  Our method achieves high sensitiv- ity and specificity and significantly reduces
  the number of plans needing measurement without generating a huge confidence interval.
  Our re- sults demonstrate the validity and applicabil- ity of conformal prediction
  methods for improv- ing efficiency and reducing the workload of the IMRT QA process.
