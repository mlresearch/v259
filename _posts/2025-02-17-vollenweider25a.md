title: 'Learning Personalized Treatment Decisions in Precision Medicine: Disentangling
  Treatment Assignment Bias in Counterfactual Outcome Prediction and Biomarker Identification'
abstract: Precision medicine has the potential to tailor treatment decisions to individual
  patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), but it faces
  significant challenges due to complex biases in clinical observational data and
  the high-dimensional nature of biological data. This study models various types
  of treatment assignment biases using mutual information and investigates their impact
  on ML models for counterfactual prediction and biomarker identification. Unlike
  traditional counterfactual benchmarks that rely on fixed treatment policies, our
  work focuses on modeling different characteristics of the underlying observational
  treatment policy in distinct clinical settings. We validate our approach through
  experiments on toy datasets, semi-synthetic tumor cancer genome atlas (TCGA) data,
  and real-world biological outcomes from drug and CRISPR screens. By incorporating
  empirical biological mechanisms, we create a more realistic benchmark that reflects
  the complexities of real-world data. Our analysis reveals that different biases
  lead to varying model performances, with some biases, especially those unrelated
  to outcome mechanisms, having minimal effect on prediction accuracy. This highlights
  the crucial need to account for specific biases in clinical observational data in
  counterfactual ML model development, ultimately enhancing the personalization of
  treatment decisions in precision medicine.
