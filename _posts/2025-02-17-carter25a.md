title: 'wav2sleep: A Unified Multi-Modal Approach to Sleep Stage Classification from
  Physiological Signals'
abstract: Accurate classification of sleep stages from less obtrusive sensor measurements
  such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmogram (PPG) could enable important
  applications in sleep medicine. Existing approaches to this problem have typically
  used deep learning models designed and trained to operate on one or more specific
  input signals. However, the datasets used to develop these models often do not contain
  the same sets of input signals. Some signals, particularly PPG, are much less prevalent
  than others, and this has previously been addressed with techniques such as transfer
  learning. Additionally, only training on one or more fixed modalities precludes
  cross-modal information transfer from other sources, which has proved valuable in
  other problem domains. To address this, we introduce wav2sleep, a unified model
  designed to operate on variable sets of input signals during training and inference.
  After jointly training on over 10,000 overnight recordings from six publicly available
  polysomnography datasets, including SHHS and MESA, wav2sleep outperforms existing
  sleep stage classification models across test-time input combinations including
  ECG, PPG, and respiratory signals.
