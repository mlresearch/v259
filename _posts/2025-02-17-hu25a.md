title: Enhancing 3D Cardiac CT Segmentation with Latent Diffusion Model and Self-Supervised
  Learning
abstract: CT cardiac imaging remains one of the most challenging visualization techniques
  among numerous CT organ imaging procedures. This is because of the dynamic nature
  of human hearts, constantly moving and pumping blood. Due to cardiac motions, CT
  scanners need to be capable of taking fast scans to capture a “snapshot” of a human
  heart. Other cardiac imaging challenges include contrast timing variations, radiation
  dose to patient bodies, limited temporal resolution, contrast agent allergies, and
  more. In this paper, we present a new latent diffusion model for 3D CT cardiac imaging
  where the model produces both image volumes and segmentation labels. The latent
  diffusion model is trained with distinct data augmentation techniques to enhance
  the variety of the generative data. This helps capture the dynamic nature of the
  cardiac images. The generative data are used in our Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
  to pre-train our Deep Learning (DL) model. Furthermore, because our latent diffusion
  model produces both images and segmentation labels, our fine-tuning process takes
  advantage of the diffusion-generated images and labels in addition to the GT data.
  We run extensive experiments to show that the latent diffusion model and the SSL
  do help improve 3D CT cardiac image segmentation performance.
