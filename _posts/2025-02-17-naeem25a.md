title: 'Path-RAG: Knowledge-Guided Key Region Retrieval for Open-ended Pathology Visual
  Question Answering'
abstract: Accurate diagnosis and prognosis assisted by pathology images are essential
  for cancer treatment selection and planning. Despite the recent trend of adopting
  deep-learning approaches for analyzing complex pathology images, they fall short
  as they often overlook the domain-expert understanding of tissue structure and cell
  composition. In this work, we focus on a challenging Open-ended Pathology VQA (PathVQA-Open)
  task and propose a novel framework named Path-RAG, which leverages HistoCartography
  to retrieve relevant domain knowledge from pathology images and significantly improves
  performance on PathVQA-Open. Admitting the complexity of pathology image analysis,
  Path-RAG adopts a human-centered AI approach by retrieving domain knowledge using
  HistoCartography to select the relevant patches from pathology images. Our experiments
  suggest that domain guidance can significantly boost the accuracy of LLaVA-Med from
  38% to 47%, with a notable gain of 28% for H&E-stained pathology images in the PathVQA-Open
  dataset. For longer-form question and answer pairs, our model consistently achieves
  significant improvements of 32.5% in ARCH-Open PubMed and 30.6% in ARCH-Open Books
  on H&E images. All our relevant codes and datasets will be open-sourced.
