title: Transfer Learning for Pediatric Glucose Forecasting
abstract: Effective blood glucose forecasting is crucial for detecting events such
  as hypo- or hyperglycemia in people with diabetes, yet remains challenging in domains
  with only small, heterogeneous datasets, such as in the pediatric field. We present
  GluTFT, a novel transfer learning approach that allows leveraging models pretrained
  on publicly available adult diabetes datasets for pediatric glucose forecasting.
  We systematically evaluate multiple transfer learning strategies, including zero-shot
  prediction and fine-tuning across the entire dataset as well as specific subgroups
  of participants. Our extensive experiments reveal that GluTFT excels on the pretraining
  datasets and significantly outperforms baseline methods when fine-tuned. To validate
  the clinical relevance of our approach, we evaluate Parkes Error Grids, demonstrating
  the quality of GluTFTâ€™s blood glucose forecasts and its potential for enhancing
  clinical decision-making for pediatric diabetes.
