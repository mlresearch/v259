title: Indication Driven Autoregressive Report Generation for Cardiac Magnetic Resonance
  Imaging
abstract: Interpreting and documenting findings from cardiac imaging studies is increasingly
  burdensome to readers in part due to the increasing amount of advanced cardiac imaging
  studies which capture multi-parametric data. This is particularly true of cardiac
  magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) studies which encode features of morphology, function,
  flow, parametric mapping, and myocardial viability in multiple 2D planes, but require
  a substantial amount of time to analyze, document, and integrate the numerous complex
  imaging features into a comprehensive report. Additionally, clearly communicating
  complex CMR findings and diagnoses to referring physicians with varying CMR knowledge
  and the ability to clinically correlated complex CMR findings is highly variable.
  Automatic interpretation and generation of the report have great potential to reduce
  the burden on readers and improve access through higher patient throughput. As such,
  there has been significant work in this area, although much of it has been focused
  on more simplistic chest X-ray and single view echocardiography. These data sources
  are represented by only a single view or have only a single source of contrast,
  greatly reducing the necessary complexity of the latent visual space. Furthermore,
  we recognize that clinical histories are important for accurate reporting. In this
  work, we propose to treat the CMR study as a multi-scene video and generate the
  corresponding report in an autoregressive manner. We further warm-start the generated
  report with the indications for the exam to improve the relevance of the generated
  report. We validate our model on two closed CMR datasets from two different institutions
  and demonstrate that our model offers significant improvements on both language
  generation metrics and human reader preference.
