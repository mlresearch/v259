title: Modeling Clinical Decision Variability in Explainable Multimodal Seizure Detection
abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a critical role in the monitoring and
  diagnosis of neurological disorders, particularly in detecting seizures and other
  harmful brain activities. However, interpreting EEG signals is a complex task that
  often suffers from high variability and subjectivity among clinical experts. This
  study introduces the BiG-WaR architecture, a comprehensive multimodal framework
  designed to classify harmful brain activity using EEG signals. BiG-WaR combines
  several neural network models, including BiLSTM, GNN, WaveNet, and ResNet, to effectively
  leverage spatial and temporal dynamics inherent in EEG data. Our approach integrates
  curriculum learning and appropriate data preprocessing to address the challenges
  of EEG analysis, such as high variability and the need for robust feature extraction.
  Initial results demonstrate that BiG-WaR framework is a robust benchmark, enhancing
  reliability and interpretability—critical factors for clinical adoption—by integrating
  attention mechanisms and gradient-weighted class activation mappings to provide
  insights into model decisions.
