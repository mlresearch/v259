title: 'MLV2-Net: Rater-Based Majority-Label Voting for Consistent Meningeal Lymphatic
  Vessel Segmentation'
abstract: Meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) are responsible for the drainage of waste
  products from the human brain. An impairment in their functionality has been associated
  with aging as well as brain disorders like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease.
  However, MLVs have only recently been described for the first time in magnetic resonance
  imaging (MRI), and their ramified structure renders manual segmentation particularly
  difficult. Further, as there is no consistent notion of their appearance, human-annotated
  MLV structures contain a high inter-rater variability that most automatic segmentation
  methods cannot take into account. In this work, we propose a new rater-aware training
  scheme for the popular nnUNet model, and we explore rater-based ensembling strategies
  for accurate and consistent segmentation of MLVs. This enables us to boost nnU-Net’s
  performance while obtaining explicit predictions in different annotation styles
  and a rater-based uncertainty estimation. Our final model, MLV2-Net, achieves a
  Dice similarity coefficient of 0.806 with respect to the human reference standard.
  The model further matches the human inter-rater reliability and replicates age-related
  associations with MLV volume.
