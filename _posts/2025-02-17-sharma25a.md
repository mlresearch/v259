title: 'MAIRA-Seg: Enhancing Radiology Report Generation with Segmentation-Aware Multimodal
  Large Language Models'
abstract: There is growing interest in applying AI to radiology report generation,
  particularly for chest X-rays (CXRs). This paper investigates whether incorporating
  pixel-level information through segmentation masks can improve fine-grained image
  interpretation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for radiology report
  generation. We introduce MAIRA-Seg, a segmentation-aware MLLM framework designed
  to utilize semantic segmentation masks alongside CXRs for generating radiology reports.
  We train expert segmentation models to obtain mask pseudolabels for radiology-specific
  structures in CXRs. Subsequently, building on the architectures of MAIRA, a CXR-specialised
  model for report generation, we integrate a trainable segmentation tokens extractor
  that leverages these mask pseudolabels, and employ mask-aware prompting to generate
  draft radiology reports. Our experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR dataset
  show that MAIRA-Seg outperforms non-segmentation baselines. We also investigate
  set-of-marks prompting with MAIRA and find that MAIRA-Seg consistently demonstrates
  comparable or superior performance. The results confirm that using segmentation
  masks enhances the nuanced reasoning of MLLMs, potentially contributing to better
  clinical outcomes.
