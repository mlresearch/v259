title: Robust Real-Time Mortality Prediction in the Intensive Care Unit using Temporal
  Difference Learning
abstract: The task of predicting long-term patient outcomes using supervised machine
  learning is a challenging one, in part because of the high variance of each patientâ€™s
  trajectory, which can result in the model over-fitting to the training data. Temporal
  difference (TD) learning, a common reinforcement learning technique, may reduce
  variance by generalising learning to the pattern of state transitions rather than
  terminal outcomes. However, in healthcare this method requires several strong assumptions
  about patient states, and there appears to be limited literature evaluating the
  performance of TD learning against traditional supervised learning methods for long-term
  health outcome prediction tasks. In this study, we define a framework for applying
  TD learning to real-time irregularly sampled time series data using a Semi-Markov
  Reward Process. We evaluate the model framework in predicting intensive care mortality
  and show that TD learning under this framework can result in improved model robustness
  compared to standard supervised learning methods, and that this robustness is maintained
  even when validated on external datasets. This approach may offer a more reliable
  method when learning to predict patient outcomes using high-variance irregular time
  series data.
