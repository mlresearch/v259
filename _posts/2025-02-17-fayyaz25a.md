title: An Interoperable Machine Learning Pipeline for Pediatric Obesity Risk Estimation
abstract: Reliable prediction of pediatric obesity can offer a valuable resource to
  providers, helping them engage in timely preventive interventions before the disease
  is established. Many efforts have been made to develop ML-based predictive models
  of obesity, and some studies have reported high predictive performances. However,
  no commonly used clinical decision support tool based on existing ML models currently
  exists. This study presents a novel end-to-end pipeline specifically designed for
  pediatric obesity prediction, which supports the entire process of data extraction,
  inference, and communication via an API or a user interface. While focusing only
  on routinely recorded data in pediatric electronic health records (EHRs), our pipeline
  uses a diverse expert-curated list of medical concepts to predict the 1-3 years
  risk of developing obesity. Furthermore, by using the Fast Healthcare Interoperability
  Resources (FHIR) standard in our design procedure, we specifically target facilitating
  low-effort integration of our pipeline with different EHR systems. In our experiments,
  we report the effectiveness of the predictive model as well as its alignment with
  the feedback from various stakeholders, including ML scientists, providers, health
  IT personnel, health administration representatives, and patient group representatives.
