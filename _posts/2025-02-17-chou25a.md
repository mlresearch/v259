title: Multimodal Classification of Alzheimer’s Disease by Combining Facial and Eye-Tracking
  Data
abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing a non-invasive
  tool for detecting Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Previous studies have shown that a
  single modality such as speech or eye-tracking (ET) data can be effective for classifying
  AD patients from healthy individuals. However, understanding the role of other modalities,
  and especially the integration of facial analysis with ET for enhancing dementia
  classification, remains under-explored. In this paper, we investigate whether we
  can leverage facial patterns in AD patients by building on EMOTION-FAN—a deep learning
  model initially developed for recognizing seven distinct human emotions, now fine-tuned
  for our facial analysis tasks. We also explore the efficacy of leveraging multimodal
  information by combining the results from the facial and ET data through a late
  fusion technique. Specifically, our approach uses a neural classifier to learn from
  raw ET data (VTNet) alongside the fine-tuned EMOTION-FAN model that learns from
  the facial data. Experimental results show that facial data gives superior results
  than ET data. Notably, we obtain higher scores when both modalities are combined,
  providing strong evidence that integrating multimodal data benefits performance
  on this task.
