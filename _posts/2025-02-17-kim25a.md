title: 'HeartMAE: Advancing Cardiac MRI Analysis through Optical Flow Guided Masked
  Autoencoding'
abstract: Cardiac MRI is a powerful diagnostic tool, but traditional analysis relies
  on complex segmentation-based workflows that may provide only a partial picture
  of cardiovascular health. To address these limitations, we introduce HeartMAE, a
  novel framework that uses masked autoencoding (MAE) to learn features directly from
  cardiac MRIs, without any labels. By incorporating optical flow during training,
  HeartMAE is guided towards cardiac regions, which significantly improves its downstream
  performance. A multitask model, built on a shared HeartMAE embedding layer, accurately
  predicts key cardiac health indicators, extracardiac features and major cardiovascular
  conditions. Moreover, HeartMAE features may be used as embeddings for clustering
  to enable patient stratification. Requiring only MRI data, HeartMAE is highly scalable
  and adaptable to larger datasets, paving the way for foundation models in cardiac
  imaging.
