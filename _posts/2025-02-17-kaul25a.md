title: Meta-Analysis with Untrusted Data
abstract: Meta-analyses are usually conducted on small amounts of “trusted” data,
  ideally from randomized, controlled trials. Excluding untrusted (observational)
  data — such as medical records and related scientific literature — avoids potential
  confounding and ensures unbiased conclusions. Unfortunately, this exclusion can
  reduce predictive accuracy to the point of clinical irrelevance, especially when
  trials are heterogeneous. This paper shows how untrusted data can be safely incorporated
  into meta-analysis, improving predictions without sacrificing rigor or introducing
  unproven assumptions. Our approach, called conformal meta-analysis, consists of
  (1) learning a (potentially flawed) prior distribution from the untrusted data,
  (2) using the prior and trusted data to derive a simple, fully-conformal prediction
  interval for the observed trial effect, and (3) analytically extracting an interval
  for the true (unobserved) effect. In multiple experiments on healthcare datasets,
  our algorithms deliver tighter, sounder intervals than traditional ones. This paper
  conceptually realigns meta-analysis as a foundation for evidence-based medicine,
  embracing heterogeneity and untrusted data for more nuanced, precise predictions.
