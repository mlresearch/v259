title: 'DynamITE: Optimal time-sensitive organ offers using ITE'
abstract: Matching donor organs to patients in need is a difficult but important problem.
  A crucial factor in transplant outcomes is the cold ischemic time of the organ,
  which increases every time an organ offer is refused. Despite this, acceptance dynamics
  have so far been neglected in favor of purely outcome driven offers. As a first
  alternative, we propose DynamITE, a novel organ allocation methodology that explicitly
  takes into account the acceptance behavior over sequences of offers. DynamITE dynamically
  updates organ acceptance estimates, cold ischemic times (CIT) and causal effects
  throughout the matching process. We demonstrate that DynamITE improves early organ
  acceptance and maximizes patient life expectancy compared to current policies.
